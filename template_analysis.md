Choosing Kanban?

Kanban is an ideal project management methodology for AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery in Western Cape Hospitals because it provides visual clarity, flexibility, and continuous improvement. Here’s why it aligns with the project’s needs:

1. Continuous Monitoring & Flow Management
AI-driven database recovery requires constant monitoring and actionable insights.

Kanban’s visual boards help track tasks like backup scheduling, anomaly detection, failure prediction, and compliance reporting in real-time.

2. Agile & Iterative Workflows
AI models and recovery systems evolve over time, requiring adaptive workflows.

Kanban allows prioritization of tasks (e.g., "Train AI Model" → "Test AI Model" → "Deploy Update"), making it perfect for an evolving system.

3. Automation & Efficiency
Automated Kanban moves tasks when conditions are met (e.g., when a failure is detected, an alert moves from "Detection" to "Investigation").

This reduces manual workload and ensures smooth recovery operations.

4. Team Collaboration & Transparency
IT teams need clear visibility of ongoing database health checks, backup statuses, and incident responses.

Kanban provides real-time tracking, ensuring everyone is aware of system updates and compliance tasks.

5. Scalability & Adaptability
Whether handling routine database maintenance or high-priority system failures, Kanban can scale to fit urgent and long-term tasks.

Conclusion:
Kanban is the best choice because it ensures structured workflow, automation, real-time monitoring, and flexibility—all critical for implementing AI-driven automated database recovery in hospitals.
