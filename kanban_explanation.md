Kanban Board Explanation

A Kanban board is a visual tool that helps teams manage and optimize their workflow by organizing tasks in a structured, easy-to-track format. It is designed to improve efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and ensure a steady flow of work.

How a Kanban Board Works:
Visualizing Workflow:
The board consists of columns that represent different stages of a taskâ€™s progress (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," and "Done").
Each task is represented as a card that moves from one column to the next as it progresses through the workflow.
This provides transparency and helps teams quickly see what work is being done and where it stands.

Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP):
Each column has a WIP limit, meaning only a set number of tasks can be in progress at the same time.
This prevents team members from taking on too much work at once, reducing bottlenecks and ensuring tasks are completed before new ones are started.
It encourages a smooth, steady workflow rather than overwhelming the system with too many incomplete tasks.

Supporting Agile Principles:
Continuous Delivery: Kanban enables teams to focus on finishing tasks rather than starting too many, allowing for frequent and smooth releases.

Adaptability: Since work is managed in small, incremental changes, teams can quickly adjust priorities based on new requirements or feedback.
Efficiency & Collaboration: The board provides a shared view of tasks, improving team coordination and communication.
A Kanban board is a simple yet powerful tool that helps teams stay organized, reduce inefficiencies, and continuously improve their workflow
